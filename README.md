# Analysis Grand Challenge implementations in modern ROOT

The analysis code can be found under [`analyses`](https://github.com/root-project/analysis-grand-challenge/tree/main/analyses/).

## About the Analysis Grand Challenge

The IRIS-HEP Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) is about performing the last steps in an analysis pipeline at scale to test workflows envisioned for the HL-LHC.
This includes:

- columnar data extraction from large datasets
- processing of that data (event filtering, construction of observables, evaluation of systematic uncertainties) into histograms
- statistical model construction and statistical inference
- visualizations for these steps

all done in a reproducible and preservable way that can scale to HL-LHC requirements.

The official AGC documentation can be found [at this link](https://agc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
